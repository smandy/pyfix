 The integrity of message data content can be verified in two ways: verification of message length and a simple 
checksum of characters. 
 
 The message length is indicated in the BodyLength field and is verified by counting the number of characters in 
the message following the BodyLength field up to, and including, the delimiter immediately preceding the 
CheckSum tag (“10=”). 
 
 The CheckSum integrity check is calculated by summing the binary value of each character from the “8” of “8=“ 
up to and including the <SOH> character immediately preceding the CheckSum tag field and comparing the 
least significant eight bits of the calculated value to the CheckSum value (see “CheckSum Calculation” 
for a complete description).

 sprintf(tmpBuf,“%03d”,(unsignedint)(cks%256)); 
 return(tmpBuf);
